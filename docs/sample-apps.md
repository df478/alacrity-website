AlaCrity is built on top of Docker container. Therefore, pretty much all applications can be deployed on AlaCrity. As mentioned in `alacran-definition` docs, there is a few simple versions of `alacran-definition` for most popular web languages such as NodeJS, PHP, python and ruby.

However, AlaCrity is not limited to these languages. For example, it can deploy a go app. You just need a Dockerfile for it. 


### Ready to be Deployed!

Inside AlaCrity repo, you can find a collection of different sample apps that are ready to be deployed! See:
https://github.com/df478/alacrity/tree/master/alacran-sample-apps

There are:
- ASP .NET
- Go app
- nginx advance app
- Python
- Ruby
- Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView
- NodeJS
- React App
- and etc...


To deploy sample apps, you just need to:
- Download the tar file of your choice.
- Go to your AlaCrity web dashboard and create a test app.
- Go to "Deployment" tab and upload the tar file!
- Done!!

Now you can unzip the tar content and see what's inside. This will give you an idea how different apps can be deployed using AlaCrity (Docker).
